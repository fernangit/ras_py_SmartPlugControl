## TP-Link Device Debug Protocol (TDDP) Client ##

A proof-of-concept python client to talk to a TP-Link device using the **TP-Link Device Debug Protocol (TDDP)**.

TDDP is implemented across a whole range of TP-Link devices including routers, access points, cameras and smartplugs.
TDDP can read and write a device's configuration and issue special commands. UDP port 1040 is used to send commands, replies come back on UDP port 61000. This client has been tested with a TP-Link Archer C9 Wireless Router and a TP-Link HS-110 WiFi Smart Plug.

TDDP is a binary protocol documented in patent [CN102096654A](https://www.google.com/patents/CN102096654A?cl=en).

Commands are issued by setting the appropriate values in the Type and SubType header fields.
Data is returned DES-encrypted and requires the username and password of the device to decrypt. Likewise, configuration data to be written to the device needs to be sent encrypted. The DES key is constructed by taking the MD5 hash of username and password concatenated together, and then taking the first 8 bytes of the MD5 hash.

#### Usage ####

   `./tddp-client.py -t <ip> -u username -p password -c 0A`

Provide the target IP using -t. You can provide a username and password, otherwise admin/admin is used as a default. They are necessary to decrypt the data that is returned.

Provide the command as a two-character hex string, e.g. -c 0A. What type of data a command might read out will be different for various TP-Link devices.

#### Example ####
Reading out the WAN link status on an Archer C9 in default configuration shows the link is down (0):
   ```
   ./tddp-client.py -t 192.168.0.1 -c 0E
   Request Data: Version 02 Type 03 Status 00 Length 00000000 ID 0001 Subtype 0e
   Reply Data:   Version 02 Type 03 Status 00 Length 00000018 ID 0001 Subtype 0e
   Decrypted:    wan_ph_link 1 0
   ```
